        <p>Nefarius (Lloyd Bloch), previously known as Moonstone, is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. As Moonstone, Lloyd Bloch was an agent of the second Secret Empire and its front organization, the Committee to Regain America's Principles (C.R.A.P.), set up by them to discredit Captain America and take his place as America's "symbolic" hero. The Empire had previously damaged Cap's reputation by accusing him of vigilantism and framing him for the death of small-time criminal the Tumbler.[2] Moonstone was empowered by a stone found in the Moon's surface, hence his codename, and he posed as a new American costumed crime-fighter. During the Secret Empire's "attack" on the White House, he claimed that he could not defeat their plans, intending to discourage resistance from the public. Moonstone was subsequently exposed, and attacked and defeated by Captain America while the Falcon, Cyclops, and Marvel Girl took out the rest of the Empire's soldiers. After the Secret Empire's defeat he was arrested.[3] His alien gem was stolen from him by his psychiatrist, Dr. Karla Sofen, who psychologically manipulated him to convince him that it was turning him into a monster and reject it, thereby losing his superhuman powers. Sofen took the gem and became the second Moonstone.[4]</p>
